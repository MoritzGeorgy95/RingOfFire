    Game of Fire is a popular card drinking game that requires players to have
    quick reflexes and a high tolerance for alcohol. The game is played with a
    deck of cards and at least four players. To start, the deck of cards is
    shuffled and placed in a circle face down. A cup filled with a shot of
    alcohol is placed in the center of the circle. Players take turns picking up
    a card from the deck and following the corresponding rule: <br> <br></p>

    <ul>
        <li>Ace: Waterfall. All players start drinking at the same time, and no one can stop until the player to their right stops.</li>

    </ul>
