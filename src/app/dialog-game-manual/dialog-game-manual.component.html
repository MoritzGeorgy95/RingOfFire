    Game of Fire is a popular card drinking game that requires players to have
    quick reflexes and a high tolerance for alcohol. The game is played with a
    deck of cards and at least four players. To start, the deck of cards is
    shuffled and placed in a circle face down. A cup filled with a shot of
    alcohol is placed in the center of the circle. Players take turns picking up
    a card from the deck and following the corresponding rule:

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h2>Waterfall</h2>
      <p>
        Everyone has to start drinking at the same time. As soon as player 1
        stops drinking, player 2 may stop drinking. Player 3 may stop as soon as
        player 2 stops drinking, and so on.
